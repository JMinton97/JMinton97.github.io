				<h2>film</h2>
				<p>I like recording things with my camera and then piecing the shots together into short videos. Occasionally I get paid to do this but mostly I just get to do it for the joy of filmmaking. Here's some of my better work (click to expand):</p>

				<h2>code</h2>
				<p>I've had the privilege of studying higher education for four years:<br>
>  a <b>BSc</b> in <b>Computer Science</b> <em>(1st Class: 77%)</em>, 2016-19<br>
> an <b>MSc</b> in <b>Human Computer Interaction</b> <em>(ongoing)</em>, 2019-20<br>
<br>
For my undergraduate final year project I developed <em>Saginaw</em>, a desktop route-finding and mapping program for long-distance cycle-touring. There's no reason to use it instead of Google Maps or Komoot or what-have-you, but it's a pretty nice representation of my abilities.</p>

			<div class = "section design pad">
				<h2>design</h2>
				<p>Visual design work has long been an interest of mine which I've been able to hone over the years. I love design focusing on a simple combination of the right fonts, colours and imagery with a focus on presenting the important information which goes hand-in-hand with my HCI studies. I'm adept with Photoshop and InDesign, as well as a pen and some paper.</p>

				<h2>photos</h2>
				<p>I got my first camera free with a magazine when I was 10. It was digital, but without a persistent memory, so if you swung it too hard
				by the strap (as 10 year olds do) the AAA batteries came out you lost all your photos. Five cameras later I'm just as enthusiastic but I treat them slightly better now.<br>
				<br>
				I mainly take pictures of nice landscapes but have a wide experience of styles so feel free to get in touch! I probably wouldn't back myself to photograph your wedding but am open to other suggestions!</p>
